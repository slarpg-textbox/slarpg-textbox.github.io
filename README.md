SLARPG Textbox web app

Fake quotes generator where you can make fake quotes with the characters from SLARPG. Options to customize subject/dialogue, sprites, font colors and sizes.

Built with react and deployed on github pages.

# Running Locally

If you'd like to build this locally then do the following: 
First install npm and then do
`npm install`
And then
`npm start`

This will open a local server in `localhost:3000` and you'll be free to edit as you please!

# Things I've Used
All sprites files were extracted from the game. Received permission from ponett that we are free to distribute these character images for this project. 

Also used the ChinaCat font which is a free font that can be obtained from [https://www.dafont.com/chinacat.font](https://www.dafont.com/chinacat.font)

Be sure to check out [Leo40Git's generator](https://github.com/Leo40Git/super-lesbian-textbox-generator) which I used for inspiration and has even more features!
